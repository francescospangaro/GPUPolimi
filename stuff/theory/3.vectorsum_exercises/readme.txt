The C program in 0_vsum.c performs the sum of two integer vectors.
Modify the program as follows:
1) accelerate the vector sum onto the GPU and compare the results against the ones obtained on the CPU. Use a block size equal to 64.
2) add error handling for all CUDA API calls. Run the program with a block size equal to -1.
3) add execution time measures for both the CPU and the GPU runs.
